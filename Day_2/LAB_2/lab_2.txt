Exercise 2: Implement Gradient Descent

Write a Python function to perform gradient descent for a single-variable linear regression. 
The function should take the following inputs:

X: An array of input values (independent variable).
y: An array of output values (dependent variable).
learning_rate: The learning rate for the gradient descent algorithm.
num_iterations: The number of iterations to run the gradient descent.

The function should initialize the coefficients b0 and b1 to some arbitrary values and then perform gradient descent to update these coefficients iteratively. 
After the specified number of iterations, the function should return the final values of b0 and b1
